TITLE Main Stairwell (Floor 3)
DESCRIPTION
You enter the stairwell, and along come some of your
friends from the common room. They softly muse and
ponder amongst themselvesâ€”you hear one mention a
"beaver," but not in any particular context. One or two
of them cough for a moment before catching their breath.

The stairwell itself is nothing special: dull, tan-white
walls and concrete steps with non-slip edge texturing.
There is some odd number of steps in the first set and
and even number down the second. Any further is anyone's
guess for now.

Before heading down the stairs, you can choose to return
to the common room. If you go down, you may not be able
to come back; it seems you don't have a keycard to
independently open the stairway door, and neither does
anyone around you. If you are confident, you can head
down the stairs.
