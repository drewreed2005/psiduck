TITLE Outside the Dining Hall
DESCRIPTION
You stand alone outside the dining hall. In the dimly-lit
surroundings, there are very few passersby. The bike
locks, their warped appearance obstructed by the darkness,
are empty. The lights in the little shop by the dining
hall are off; it is populated only by snacks and cheap
on-the-go resources. The hall itself remains litâ€”you
can see one or two employees cleaning the floor and wiping
down the tables.

You lose focus from the material, tangible surroundings
and look up. In the sky sits the bright, brilliant, full
moon. Its energy emanates down and outward, free yet
controlled. It is as if the moon's energy is seeping
into your skin.

It is an experience you have never truly absorbed before.
Perhaps it is one that would be made better by the
presence of others.
