TITLE Elevator (Floor 3)
DESCRIPTION
You stand alone in the elevator. The smooth, reflective,
metal-textured elevator walls make you feel as if you
have stepped into the future. The panel of buttons is
covered with caution tapeâ€”it seems that the elevator is
out of order, but they haven't yet covered the exterior
with tape.

None of the buttons work; the elevator is completely
dysfunctional. It seems you'll be stuck until someone
comes to help you. You are left alone, sitting in the
claustrophobic elevator.
