TITLE Your Dorm
DESCRIPTION
Before you can knock on your dorm room door (as it seems
you've misplaced your room key), one of your roommates
leaves swiftly and lets you in.

In your dorm, you see your two other roommates. One is at
his computer, completing a near-due assignment. The
other sits in bed on his phone, watching Instagram reels.
The blinds are closed, but the lights are on, giving you
a good view of the beds and desks. All the posters and
desk decorations are as you remember: the video game art
from Comic-Con, the large Strokes album cover poster, and
the large "Currents" and "Blue Album" posters that cannot
quite fit anywhere. Nobody seems to be able to find their
room keys.

Now that you've taken stock of the dorm, all you can
really do is go back to the common room.
