TITLE Outside the Student Housing Tower (Floor 1)
DESCRIPTION
You stand outside the Student Housing tower with a
small crowd of friends from school. One or two faces
pass by, all with their own journeys to pursue. Aside
from them and the friends who surround you, there is only
dim elevated lights and outdoor utilities like garbage
bins and benches. To your left is an empty road and to
the right is a path to the dining hall.

You lose focus from the material, tangible surroundings
and look up. In the sky sits the bright, brilliant, full
moon. Its energy emanates down and outward, free yet
controlled. It is as if the moon's energy is seeping
into your skin.

It is an experience you have never truly absorbed before,
and you are glad to have experienced it with so many
familiar faces. They seem glad to have experienced it
with you, too. Some small part of you, small and hidden
under the guilt of internal greed, wishes your closest
friends could be with you to see it.
