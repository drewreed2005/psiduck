TITLE Outside the Student Housing Tower (Floor 2)
DESCRIPTION
You stand with your small third-floor group on the
second floor of the exterior area to the Student
Housing tower. In the sparse lighting, you can see
the surrounding planter greenery quite clearly. The
trees and bushes obstruct your view of the mall benches
and skylight windows into the dining hall. Wishing to
take in more of the view, you step out of the cover of
the middle section of the tower.

You lose focus from the material, tangible surroundings
and look up. In the sky sits the bright, brilliant, full
moon. Its energy emanates down and outward, free yet
controlled. It is as if the moon's energy is seeping
into your skin.

It is an experience you have never truly absorbed before.
Your group, although small, seems to have been brought
closer by this experience. You consider if this singular
investment in friendly development would have been better
spent on friends you are already closer with, but silence
that thought under the beauty of the moonlight.
