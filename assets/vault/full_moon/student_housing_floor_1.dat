TITLE Student Housing (Floor 1)
DESCRIPTION
Down the stairs is the first floor of the student
housing building. Some new familiar faces—friends from
your classes and your clubs—join you and your third-
floor friends on your trip.

Nobody wants to go back up the stairs, since you can't
get back to your floor anyway, so your only option is
to go outside.
