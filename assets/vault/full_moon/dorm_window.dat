TITLE Your Dorm
DESCRIPTION
You open the blinds and look out the window. You and
your friends are in awe. In the sky sits the bright,
brilliant, full moon. Its energy emanates down and
outward, free yet controlled. It is as if the moon's
energy is seeping into your skin.

It is an experience you have never truly absorbed before.
The group that stands with you in your room, made up of
your favorite people you met and spent time with in
college so far, is equally awestruck. You feel as if
you've grown closer with all the important people in
your life, and you're excited to see what more your
college journey will bring.
