TITLE Elevator (Floor 3)
DESCRIPTION
You stand with your friends in the elevator. The smooth,
reflective, metal-textured elevator walls make you feel
as if you have stepped into the future. The panel of
buttons is covered with caution tapeâ€”it seems that the
elevator is out of order, but they haven't yet covered
the exterior with tape.

None of the buttons work; the elevator is completely
dysfunctional. It seems you and your friends are stuck
until someone comes to help you. While everyone is
upset that they may miss the "lunar event," you still
find yourself bonding with everyone due to your
unfortunate circumstances.
