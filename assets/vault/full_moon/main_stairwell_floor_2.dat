TITLE Main Stairwell (Floor 2)
DESCRIPTION
You and your friends from the third floor head down the
stairs, closing the door behind you. After making your
way down two strips of stairs, you find yourself before
two doors. The one directly in front of you, which is
marked by a sign reading "★2", seems to lead outside.
The door to your right has more stairs just beyond
it.

So, you can go forward through the "★2" door to the
outside, or you can go through the right door and
descend even more stairs.
