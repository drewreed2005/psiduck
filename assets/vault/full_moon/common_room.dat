TITLE Common Room (Floor 3)
DESCRIPTION
Upon reviewing your options with the friends who have
joined you, it seems the "Big Back Tunnel" is no longer
an option; they said they "aren't hungry."

"What we crave," according to the tallest of the friend
group, "is a lunar sighting." Once again, someone
mentions a "beaver."
