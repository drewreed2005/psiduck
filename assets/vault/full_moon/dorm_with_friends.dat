TITLE Your Dorm
DESCRIPTION
You knock on your door, and one of the two roommates who
sat inside lets you in. He's happy to see that you came
with the group, and so is your other roommate.

The group of friends comments on the decorations on the
walls, the big new music posters, and the photo wall on
your roommate's closet that continues to grow. One of
your friends comments on the blinds being closed: "Why
keep them closed? I bet the view's great."

Now that your friends have spent some time in your
room, they seem to be getting antsy. "The lunar event
is happening," one mentions again. You can choose to
return to the common room if you want.
