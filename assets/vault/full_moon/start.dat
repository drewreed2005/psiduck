TITLE Student Housing (Floor 3)
DESCRIPTION
It is November 16th, 2024. There is an unfamiliar glow
in the air. While the tone of conversation in the common
room had grown melancholy, the students seem somehow more
energized than just before.

The room is painted a mix of mid-lime-green and white,
with saturated oak wood furniture completing the palette.
Cheap Christmas decorations fill in some of the gaps.
Seating arrangements and tables line the room. There are
students scattered across the room speaking about the
notable events of the day, sticking to the general sense
of gloom masked by a subtle, youthful energy. Given the
tone of the room, perhaps it is best not to speak to them.

You can enter your dorm room, the main stairwell, the so-
called "Big Back Tunnel," or the nearby elevator.
