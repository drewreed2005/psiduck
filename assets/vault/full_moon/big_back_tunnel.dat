TITLE The "Big Back Tunnel"
DESCRIPTION
Despite the somewhat playful name, the "tunnel" is really
a brutalist, concrete stairwell. Unlike the main stairwell,
exposed red pipes are a frequent sight and changes in
direction are constant obstacle. Even so, the tunnel is
belovedâ€”such is the consequence of bringing college
students straight to a convenient source of food.

You can go down and exit the stairwell, leading to the area
right outside the dining hall, but you can't re-enter the
"Big Back Tunnel" from the bottom. If that doesn't sound
promising, you can still go back to the common room.
